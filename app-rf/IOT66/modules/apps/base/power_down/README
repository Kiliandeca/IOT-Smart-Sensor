This example shows the support of the deep power down functionnality of the
LPC1224 micro-controller.

Once in deep power down, the LPC1224 can only be woken up by an RTC interrupt
or the WAKEUP pin going LOW (pin 39, GPIO1_3).
Even the RESET pin going Low will not reset the micro-controller.

In this example, the LPC1224 goes to deep power down mode when ISP button is
released.
You must either add an external pull-up and a button to the GPIO1_3 (AD5) Pin
of the LPC1224-BO Board, or Power the board OFF and ON again.
