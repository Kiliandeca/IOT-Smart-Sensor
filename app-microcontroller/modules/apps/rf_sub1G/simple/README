This module uses the CC1101 transceiver to provide Sub 1GHz Rf connectivity.

The module also integrates a TMP101 temparature sensor, the usual bi-color led
used for status, a RTC quartz, a DC-DC step-up for button battery power source
support, and an extension port with a set of gpio, including ADC (2), PWM (2),
I2C and SWD debug port.
