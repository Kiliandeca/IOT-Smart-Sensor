/* The user information block is persistant flash memory block which can be programmed
 *   and read by user code using IAP calls.
 * It can provide the same functionnality as an EEPROM, though the reading access is
 *   much more simple.
 * Writting to the user flash is slightly more complicated though, mainly because flash
 *   pages in the user information block are big 512 bytes blocks, much more than the
 *   usual small eeprom pages.
 * One must erase a full page before modifying data in it, thus reading it first to RAM,
 *   modifying the RAM area, erasing the page, and then writting back.
 * Reading/modify/write may be limited to the required size, but erase size will always
 *   be a full page.

/* The user information block of the LPC122x has three 512 bytes pages. */

/* Actually, the only purpose of this code is to return the address of the begining
 *   of the user information block in flash, set by the linker from information in
 *   the liker script (lpc_link_lpc1224.ld).
