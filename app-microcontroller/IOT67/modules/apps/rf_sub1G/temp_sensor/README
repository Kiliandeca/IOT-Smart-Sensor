This test uses the onboard TMP101 temparature sensor and a second external
TMP101 sensor and implements the DTPlug serial communication protocol.

The logger application is used on the host for sending periodic temperature
aquisition requests.


Note that the two sensor will give different temperatures. The onbord one
provides the board temperature which is four to six (!) degrees above the room
temperature mesured by the second (external) sensor

All the RF part has been removed to make protocol tests simpler.
They will be re-implemented for future tests.
The RGB led related parts have been kept but are not used yet.
