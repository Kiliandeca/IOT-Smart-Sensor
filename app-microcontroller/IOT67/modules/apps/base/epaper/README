This example shows the support of the E-paper display from embedded Artists which is
an adapter for Pervasive Display e-ink screen.

In order to create an image for the display, make a 264x176 image, black and white.
Using gimp, export as "Raw data image" (*.data).
In the popup, select "Standard (R, V, B)" and "R, V, B (normal)".

Then use the programm from the image_converter sub-directory to convert to e-paper
format. (Use the Makefile in the sub-directory to compile).

And use:
./bw_raw_data_gimp_to_bw_epaper  input.data  output.epaper

Current Makefile appends all raw images (*.epaper) to the firmware binary (epaper.bin)
to generate the new binary which you should upload: epaper.img

Current main only handles two images.
Pressing the ISP button toggles between the images.

Data received on UART0 is displayed on the first line when either of '\r', '\n' or '\0' is
received.
The maximum size of the line is 33 characters for the 2.7" epaper deisplay.
