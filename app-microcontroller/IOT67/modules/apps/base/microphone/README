This example shows the support of the internal ADC in continuous sampling (burst)
mode, with high data rate transmission over serial line (1.152Mbits/s)

The conversion results are sent over the UART0 serial line (1152000 8n1) creating
simple raw, 8bit, 1channel audio files.
Play them using aplay and the following parameters :
$ aplay -t raw -f U8 -r 22000 aud.raw

The quality is much better using mems microphone. Used ADMP401 for the test, on
a Sparkfun breakout board.
