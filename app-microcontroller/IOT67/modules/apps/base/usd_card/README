This example reads data from the first 16 bytes of the first four bolcs of
the SD card to collect a message to be displayed, and then stores temperature
data on the SD, with one sample on each successive block, starting on the
fifth block.

This demonstrates basic usage of the SD, but is very inefective for recent
SD cards (SDHC and SDXC) as they have fixed 512 bytes blocks : this will
leave the remaining part of the 512 bytes "empty".
A better usage should store up to 512 bytes of data before writting to the
SD card.

In order to write the "hello" messages to the SD card, use something like
this (adapt to the SD device name) :
SDDEV="/dev/sdc"
echo "This message is not much usefull, and gonna get split." > /tmp/msg
for i in $(seq 0 3) ; do
   dd if=/tmp/msg of=$SDDEV ibs=16 obs=512 count=1 skip=$i seek=$i
done

In order to display data from the SD, you can use hexdump :
SDDEV="/dev/sdc"
hexdump -n 6000 -C $SDDEV
