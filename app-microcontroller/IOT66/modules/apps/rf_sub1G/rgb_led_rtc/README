This module uses the CC1101 transceiver to provide Sub 1GHz Rf connectivity.

The module also integrates a TMP101 temparature sensor, the usual bi-color led
used for status, a RTC quartz, a DC-DC step-up for button battery power source
support, and an extension port with a set of gpio, including ADC (2), PWM (3),
I2C and SWD debug port.

This sample programm can be used on two modules to demonstrate RF communication.
One is used to send commands to the other one, which changes the RGB Led color
and can also report current temperature and battery status.
