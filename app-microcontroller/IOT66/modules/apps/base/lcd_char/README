This example shows the support of the LCD Character displays compatible with the
Hitachi HD44780 driver.
This demo application has also been used to test the Max31588 thermocouple to digital
converter.


The demo uses two LCD Character displays, one 20x4 characters connected using 8 data
lines, and a second 16x2 characters display connected using 4 data lines.

Upon start both displays should print "Techno-Innov".

Data received on UART0 is displayed on the "next" line of the first display as it is
received, unless it starts with character '/', in which case it goes on the second line
of the second display.

The first line of the second display is used to display the temperature read from the
Max31588 over SPI.


Note :
Some functions of the lcd_char library have not been tested.
The "busy bit" reading is not working properly (always returned as not busy).
Data reading has not been tested.
Moving the cursor or the display has not been tested either.
