This example shows the support of the IÂ²C driver for the SSD130x oled display
controller, as found on MCOT128064N2Z-YM DISPLAY from MIDAS, used on
Seeed-Studio's 128 x 64 Oled display board, and on Techno-Innov's Scialys
display board.

Other display are supported by using charge_pump configuration setting.

The example starts with one pixel line "on" per character line, and then
displays text received from the uart on the second line of the display.
