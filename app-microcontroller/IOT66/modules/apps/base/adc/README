This example shows the support of the internal ADC, with conversion examples for
a TMP36 analog temperature sensor and a CdS photoresistor.

The conversion results are sent on the UART0 serial line (115200 8n1) at
regular intervals, and the status led flashes the rest of the time.

The output looks like this :
 ADC(0): 684 (raw: 0x02ac)
 TMP36: 29,36 (orig: 248, raw: 00f8)

The first line displays the decimal and hexadecimal value of the raw
conversion result, on which was the luminosity sensor.
The second line displays the TMP36 temperature, which is not very acurate at
ambient temperature, with the corresponding decimal and hexadecimal raw
conversion values.
