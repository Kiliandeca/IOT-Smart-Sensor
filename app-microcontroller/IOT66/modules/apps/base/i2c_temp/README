This example shows the support of the TMP101 I2C temperature sensor used on the
GPIO Demo module.


Periodic temperature conversions (decimal velue and raw conversion value) are
sent on UART0 using the following frame format :
Temp read: 27,3 - raw: 0x1b60.

FIXME : Add support for the alert pin of the TMP101 temperature sensor.
Send an alert on both UART0 and UART1
Stop the chenillard as long as the alert condition is present.
