This example shows the support of the ultrasonic range measurement module from Seeed studio :
http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/index.php?title=Ultra_Sonic_range_measurement_module

The distance is sent over UART0 every 50ms.

Note that for the tests the ultrasonic module is powered at 3.3V and that the right distance
is given by dividing the pulse width by 29 instead of 58 (value given on the ultrasonic
module wiki page).
