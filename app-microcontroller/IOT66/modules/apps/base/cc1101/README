This example shows the support of the CC1101 transceiver.

Data received on the first UART (UART0) is sent on RF when an '\r' or '\n' is
received.
Data between any of these characters must not exceed 59 bytes or the whole
buffer is dropped.

Data received on RF is sent on UART0, with additional "\r\n" appended.

Debug information is sent on UART1

Connexion to a CC1101 module is quite simple, the pin numbers are easily found
at the beginning of the main.c file (pio_config and cc1101_cs_pin).


TODO : Add GDO0 and GDO2 support for special functions and interrupts from
       CC1101 on packet received with CRC OK.
