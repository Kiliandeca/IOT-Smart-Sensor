This example shows the support of the WS2812 chainable leds.
It has been tested using a 60 leds strip from Adafruit.

WS2812 external driver development is based on data found in the WS2812.pdf
datasheet provided by Adafruit : https://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf


The external driver (extdrv/ws2812.[ch]) provides an internal buffer which size
is defined in extdrv/ws2812.h (NB_LEDS)
This buffer is filled using ws2812_set_pixel(), and the led values are sent to
the led strip using ws2812_send_frame().


This example uses the driver and adds some filling functions selected by the
module ISP button or commands received on UART0 serial line.
Leds data is generated by the filling functions either from pre-defined
patterns or using ADC samples or UART received data.
Not all functions have been implemented yet.

TODO : Implement other functions / modes.
