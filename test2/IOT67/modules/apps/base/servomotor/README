This example shows the support of PWM for servo-motor control.
Servo-motor position is set by reading on ADC input 0.

The PWM signal is output on port 0 pin 19 (LPC_TIMER_32B0_M1_PIO_0_19), using
32 bits timer 0, match channel 1.

The duty cycle is defined at the beginning of the code using "DUTY_INVERTED".
Set to "1" to get an inverted duty-cycle signal, for use with a single transistor
or mosfet.
Set to "0" to get a non-inverted signal, for use with two transistors or mosfets,
or with none.
